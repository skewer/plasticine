Now using two CUs with interconnects
This simulation takes four steps:
1. Gatelevel netlist synthesis using design compiler
2. Place-and-Route using ic compiler
3. Gatelevel netlist simulation using iverilog and standard cell model
4. Time-based power analysis using primetime

All the dependencies are set in the param.tcl file under the project directory.
The testbenches can be accessed under verif/ folder.
Results of design compiler are stored in dc_reports/
Results of icc compiler are stored in icc_reports/
Results of iverilog are stored in sim.log
Results of primetime are stored in pt_reports/

To run the simulation, first source the source.sh file in setup/. Then chmod +x flow.sh and run ./flow.sh
